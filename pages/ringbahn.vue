          The Ringbahn is an iconic, political, and cultural element of the city
          of Berlin. Daily used by around 400.000 Berliners, it defines the
          geography of the city throughout its precise one-hour ride. The
          Ringbahn line sets a limit between the inner and the outer city,
          connecting as well as excluding. This project is interested in
          exploring these contradictions by altering essentially one of its
          intrinsic factors: speed.

          This walking experiment takes place between the built city and the
          urban voids. In this space of encounter, walking becomes the tool with
          which to approach this marginal landscape, by recognizing geographies
          in the chaos of peripheries, and inventing new narratives for unknown
          territories.

          What happens on the margins of a highly frequented infrastructure?
          What type of landscapes are spontaneously produced by the entropy of
          the city? How can I explain the complex geography of a city like
          Berlin from my own perceptions?

          ‘The aim is to indicate walking as an aesthetic tool capable of
          describing and modifying those metropolitan spaces that often have a
          nature still demanding comprehension, to be filled with meanings
          rather than designed and filled with things. Walking then turns out to
          be a tool which, precisely due to the simultaneous reading and writing
          of space intrinsic to it, lends itself to attending to and interacting
          with the mutability of those spaces, so as to intervene in their
          continuous becoming by acting in the field, in the here and now of
          their transformation, sharing from the inside in the mutations of
          these spaces that defy the conventional tools of contemporary design.’

          This list contains a series of actions that can be a useful aesthetic
          tool with which to explore, transform and activate the hybrid
          territories of the contemporary city. These actions can be combined in
          14.792 different ways. The active subjects are to challenge their
          creativity and follow their intuitions and to play physically with
          these concepts, challenging the possibilities offered by the
          surrounding environment.

          Walking along the Ringbahn generates tensions. it is a political and
          cultural act. it is not just wandering, having a walk, strolling...
          this type of walking generates conflict.

          ‘It was by walking that man began to construct the natu- ral landscape
          of his surroundings. and in our own century we have formulated the
          categories for interpreting the urban landscapes that surround us by
          walking through them.’

          The atlas aims to create a visual narrative of the landscape of the
          Ringbahn, understood as an ecology in itself, with a system of
          relations between different elements and patterns across the territory
          which can be associated, identified and catalogued.

          A crack, a fissure, reveals an opportunity, the possibility that
          something can happen, that there is space for other realities. When
          trespassing these physical frontiers one becomes automatically a
          marginal body, a part of the landscape.

          Prehistorical menhirs, as described by F. Careri, gave information
          about the ‘geography of the place’. Perhaps in the super- modernity
          era specific geography is not so important anymore. The conditions of
          space are dictated by economic reasons. Along the Ringbahn, the visual
          landscape is filled with contemporary versions of the prehistorical
          menhir. These can be found under the shape of billboards, on
          ‘Brandwände’, or as pilled up containers. Advertising determines the

          These artificial topographies are the testimony of the different

          ‘(...) It was hard to tell the new highway from the old road; they
          were both confounded into a unitary chaos. Since it was Saturday, many
          machines were not working, and this caused them to resemble
          prehistoric creatures trapped in the mud, or, better, extinct
          machines—mechanical dinosaurs stripped of their skin.’

          If we understand entropy as what we leave as unproductive in terms of
          energy balance, we will realize that what we call the margin
          constitutes an ideal receptacle in which to place everything that is
          not directly useful to the more or less organized configuration of the
          city.

          The blurred limits of the urban, the peri-urban space, that have
          neither the vocation nor the capacity to offer the specific con-
          ditions of the urban, by default become catalysts of everything that
          we do not want in our cities: large transport infrastructures,
          industries, distribution, and logistic zones of large scale, and all
          the possible forms of civil engineering and debris.

          The entropic landscapes are spaces in which disorderly, un- planned
          elements gradually accumulate all sorts of worthless, impersonal,
          noisy and undesirable constructions, infrastructures and objects.

          The content available on the digital archive of the Ringbahn aims to
          offer a framework and a set of resources for walking, exploring and
          understanding the landscape. The conducted research is an on-going
          project and is therefore always subject to alterations and
          collaborations. Although the content tries to be broad enough to cover
          the spectre of the Ringbahn’s elements, it is created from my own
          perceptions and subjectivities and may therefore be reappropriated and
          redefined by other walkers.
