          In the context of the Anthropocene, climate change and the urgency to
          find new ways of relating and grounding ourselves to the earth, the
          aim of this research project was to explore multispecies thinking, to
          find new ways of reading the city from this more than human
          perspective and to imagine a naturecultural implementation into the
          existing urban fabric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following ideas of post-humanism, and –dualism, and the new
          materialisms, the corresponding ontological shift invites to change
          the perception of the world from one full of objects and subjects, to
          one full of agentic beings that are inextricably connected with each
          other. Through opening subjectivity to the whole, the notion of care
          can be implemented as a new form of relational ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaning on this new ontology and conception of ethics, a speculation
          gives rise to novel soil spaces on discontinued graveyard sites and
          the implementation of corresponding soil practices, including the
          composting of deceased bodies. The imagined proposal acts as a thought
          object to discover multispecies thinking through a typological
          approach. It is an attempt to find new ways of relating to nonhumans;
          to think a space from the soils perspective, turning it from a
          resource to the protagonist, connecting everything else involved.

          Braided reciprocities in ongoing vibrance,<br />

          The future of contemporary graveyards is uncertain. As the demand for
          religious burials decreases, their gradual discontinuation leaves many
          of them in a potential state of transformation. Discussions about
          their future mainly turn around the reuse as recreational parks or as
          building plots for residential housing. Through a multispecies lens,
          other potentials emerge worth considering. In the face of ecological
          crisis, our contemporary burial and mourning culture seem worth to be
          reconsidered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at current burial procedures by ecological means, unveils
          their problematic condition. Soils are polluted with concrete tombs,
          steel coffins and lacquer finishes. Cremation emits substantial
          amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and requires huge
          quantities of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life and death are necessary partners in the ecological cycle of
          ongoingness. Rethinking our burial practice through a materialistic
          lens leads to a proposition that returns our bodies to the very
          foundation of all life cycles: The composting of human and non human
          deceased bodies into fertile soil and its reintegration into
          productive cycles, providing nourishment, for living human and non
          human bodies. The proposal reconfigures the graveyard typology:
        </p>
      </AppBox>
      <AppBox width="medium">
        <p>
          The convergence of compost burial grounds and permacultural gardening,
          gives rise to a space for soil-centred practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dissolution of individual graves into a shared and maintained
          garden, grows out of the alignment with a horizontal and relational
          ontology of all living beings. Human and non human bodies become
          entangled in recomposed matter, to form the collective ground of new
          life. A collective ground for the implementation of a new cosmology.
        </p>
        <p>
          This invites to reimagine and extend our ways of mourning: Honouring
          the dead can manifest in care for the living. Decay can be valued as
          the foundation of new beginnings. Grief for the loss can be eased
          through gratitude for the emerging.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of those everyday doings lies the incentive to sup- port
          the growth and healing of existing urban ecosystems and our connection
          to them, increasing their inherent resilience, biodiversity and
          productivity. It is a practice that foregrounds the importance of
          care, maintenance and repair to the very material sustaining of the
          world.
        </p>

          Valuing practice-sharing, teaching and community building, Terrapolis
          could be enriched with pedagogic facilities in symbiosis with the
          space:
        </p>
      </AppBox>
      <AppBox width="medium">
        <p>
          Daycare centers and schools to foster multispecies, decolonized,
          posthuman education models and soil research and permaculture training
          facilities to expand the practice further into society.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is particularly in the uneventful, everyday doings, that
          transformation can start to take shape; that new ways of becoming-with
          each other can be brought into existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          To look closely at soil, and find ways to familiarize with it,
          rediscovering its condition as living matter coexisting with us, has
          the potential to give us a necessary grounding and agency need- ed in
          times of connection loss and crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This new kind of typology could be imagined as the nurturing ground
          for an emerging soil and earth-bound community, where scientific
          knowledge converges with social activism and transversal thinking.
          Turning humans from soil-consumers into soil community members, it is
          an attempt to approach multispecies thinking through a systematic
          reconfiguration.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if we only had to look once again closely, to find ourselves?
